METALAUNCHER is a program meant for creating and showcasing your game collections. 

Rather than intended as a generic game launcher (such as Playnite or LaunchBox), the intention here is to use it to launch all the games in one specific series for the sake of having everything organized in one neat little package, similar to official game collections put out by game companies.
